# Mazmoti

Social game developed in free time inspired on [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [Doodle Dungeon](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/299939/doodle-dungeon)

This game consists in two phases:
1. Make a dungeon with random pieces of emojis and share it.
2. Resolve the dungeon and enter in a leaderboard of the best dungeon.

Make it with React.
